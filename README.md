# go-secretvalue - Don't send secrets to logs

This Go library doesn't do much except encourage your to mark all your
application secrets properly.

Instead of:
```go
secret := os.GetEnv("OAUTH_TOKEN")
```

Write:
```go
secret := secretvalue.New("oauth-token")
secret.SetString(os.GetEnv("OAUTH_TOKEN"))
```

By doing so, it will prevent the secrets from going to the logs inadvertedly.

The `secret.String()` function exposes the secret name instead of the value,
which avoids sending these into logs by mistake. This happens a lot, trust me.

## Companies that have sent passwords to logs by mistake

Remember these are only publicly known instances.

## Missing features

* Optionally use `mlock(2)` on supported systems to prevent the value from
  going to swap.

## Other attacks

This library doesn't prevent the value from going to swap disk. Make sure to
disable swap on all of your servers. `swapoff -a`
